- Top N Customer Analysis Dashboard -

Hi there! 
This project is all about diving deep into customer spending behavior and making it super easy to see who your top customers are and how they’re performing over time.

It’s built with using Power BI, PostgreSQL, and a bit of Python magic to clean and prep the data.

- What you’ll find in this project -

✅ Dynamic KPIs – Quickly switch between MTD, QTD, YTD, and YoY Growth with a single dropdown.
✅ Time Slicers – Filter by year, month, and even by the first order date.
✅ Helpful Tooltips – Hover over KPIs to understand exactly what they mean.
✅ Color Highlights – Instantly see positive/negative trends with conditional formatting.
✅ Interactive Maps and Charts – Spot trends by country, customer, or time at a glance.
